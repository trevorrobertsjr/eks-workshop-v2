In addition to provisioning individual cloud resources, Crossplane offers a higher abstraction layer called Compositions. Compositions allow users to build opinionated templates for deploying cloud resources. For example, organizations may require certain tags to be present to all AWS resources or add specific encryption keys for all Amazon Simple Storage (S3) buckets. Platform teams can define these self-service API abstractions within Compositions and ensure that all the resources created through these Compositions meet the organization’s requirements.

A `CompositeResourceDefinition` (or XRD) defines the type and schema of your Composite Resource (XR). It lets Crossplane know that you want a particular kind of XR to exist, and what fields that XR should have. An XRD is a little like a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), but slightly more opinionated. Writing an XRD is mostly a matter of specifying an OpenAPI ["structural schema"](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/).

First, lets provide a definition that can be used to create a database by members of the application team in their corresponding namespace. In this example the user only needs to specify `databaseName`, `storageGB` and `secret` location

```file
automation/controlplanes/crossplane/compositions/definition.yaml
```

Create this composite definition:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f /workspace/modules/automation/controlplanes/crossplane/compositions/definition.yaml
compositeresourcedefinition.apiextensions.crossplane.io "xrelationaldatabases.awsblueprints.io" deleted
```

A Composition lets Crossplane know what to do when someone creates a Composite Resource. Each Composition creates a link between an XR and a set of one or more Managed Resources - when the XR is created, updated, or deleted the set of Managed Resources are created, updated or deleted accordingly.

The following Composition provisions the managed resources `DBSubnetGroup`, `SecurityGroup` and `DBInstance`:

```file
automation/controlplanes/crossplane/compositions/composition/composition.yaml
```

Apply this to our EKS cluster:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -k /workspace/modules/automation/controlplanes/crossplane/compositions/composition
composition.apiextensions.crossplane.io/rds-mysql.awsblueprints.io created
```

Once we’ve configured Crossplane with the details of the new XR we can either create one directly or use a Claim. Typically only the team responsible for configuring Crossplane (often a platform or SRE team) have permission to create XRs directly. Everyone else manages XRs via a lightweight proxy resource called a Composite Resource Claim (or claim for short).

With this claim the developer only needs to specify a default database name, size, and location to store the credentials to connect to the database. This allows the platform or SRE team to standardize on aspects such as database engine, high-availability architecture and security configuration.

```file
automation/controlplanes/crossplane/compositions/claim/claim.yaml
```

Create the database by creating a `Claim`:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -k /workspace/modules/automation/controlplanes/crossplane/compositions/claim
relationaldatabase.awsblueprints.io/rds-eks-workshop created
```

It takes some time to provision the AWS managed services, in the case of RDS up to 10 minutes. Crossplane will report the status of the reconciliation in the status field of the Kubernetes custom resources.

To verify that the provisioning is done you can check that the condition “Ready” is true using the Kubernetes CLI. Run the following commands and they will exit once the condition is met:

```bash timeout=1200
$ kubectl wait relationaldatabase.awsblueprints.io ${EKS_CLUSTER_NAME}-catalog-composition -n catalog --for=condition=Ready --timeout=20m
dbinstances.rds.services.k8s.aws/rds-eks-workshop condition met
```

Crossplane will have automatically created a Kubernetes secret object that contains the credentials to connect to the RDS instance:

```bash
$ kubectl get secret catalog-db-composition -n catalog -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  endpoint: cmRzLWVrcy13b3Jrc2hvcC5jamthdHFkMWNucnoudXMtd2VzdC0yLnJkcy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29t
  password: eGRnS1NNN2RSQ3dlc2VvRmhrRUEwWDN3OXpp
  port: MzMwNg==
  username: YWRtaW4=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2023-01-26T15:12:41Z"
  name: catalog-db-composition
  namespace: catalog
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: rds.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
    controller: true
    kind: DBInstance
    name: rds-eks-workshop
    uid: bff607d9-86f2-4710-aabd-e60985b56995
  resourceVersion: "28395"
  uid: 1407281b-d282-42d8-b898-733400d3d11a
type: connection.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
```

Update the application to use the RDS endpoint and credentials:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -k /workspace/modules/automation/controlplanes/crossplane/compositions/application
namespace/catalog unchanged
serviceaccount/catalog unchanged
configmap/catalog unchanged
secret/catalog-db unchanged
service/catalog unchanged
service/catalog-mysql unchanged
service/ui-nlb created
deployment.apps/catalog configured
statefulset.apps/catalog-mysql unchanged
$ kubectl rollout status -n catalog deployment/catalog --timeout=30s
```

An NLB has been created to expose the sample application for testing:

```bash
$ kubectl get service -n ui ui-nlb -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].hostname}{'\n'}"
k8s-ui-uinlb-a9797f0f61.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

To wait until the load balancer has finished provisioning you can run this command:

```bash timeout=300
$ wait-for-lb $(kubectl get service -n ui ui-nlb -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].hostname}{'\n'}")
```

Once the load balancer is provisioned you can access it by pasting the URL in your web browser. You will see the UI from the web store displayed and will be able to navigate around the site as a user.
