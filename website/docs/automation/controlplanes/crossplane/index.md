[Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) is an open source project in the CNCF that transforms your Kubernetes cluster into a universal control plane. Crossplane enables platform teams to assemble infrastructure from multiple vendors, and expose higher level self-service APIs for application teams to consume, without having to write any code.

Crossplane extends your Kubernetes cluster to support orchestrating any infrastructure or managed service. Compose Crossplaneâ€™s granular resources into higher level abstractions that can be versioned, managed, deployed and consumed using your favorite tools and existing processes.
