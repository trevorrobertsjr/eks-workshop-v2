A [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) is a Kubernetes object that provides declarative updates to pods and replicaSets. It tells Kubernetes how to create or modify instances of pods. Deployments help to scale the number of replica pods and enable rollout or rollback a deployment version in a controlled manner. In this example (below), you can see 2 deployments for namespace <i>carts</i>.
