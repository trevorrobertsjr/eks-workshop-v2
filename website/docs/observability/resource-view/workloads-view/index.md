To view the Kubernetes resources, click on the <i>Resources</i> tab. Drill down to the <i>Workload</i> section and you can view several of the Kubernetes API resource types that are part of workloads. Workloads encompass the running containers in your cluster, and include Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, and DaemonSets. These are fundamental building blocks for running containers with a cluster.
